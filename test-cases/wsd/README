fnTBL for Word Sense Disambiguation


Commands to run to train the fnTBL for the adjective 'free':

Training:
  ../../bin/fnTBL-train free.train free.rls -F tbl.20.params \
	          -allPositiveRules 4 -threshold 0

Applying:
  ../../bin/fnTBL free.test free.rls -F tbl.20.params -o free.out
  ../../exec/mcompute_error.prl -T '|' free.out

Obs: The treshold of 4 was obtained by running cross-validation on the
entire Senseval training data.
