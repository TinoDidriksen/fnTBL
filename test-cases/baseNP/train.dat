The DT I
new JJ I

would MD O
be VB O
similar JJ O
to TO O

The DT I

is VBZ O
that IN O

would MD O

retain VB O

The DT I

how WRB O

One CD I

the DT B

some DT I

The DT I

But CC O
Citicorp NNP I

One CD I

the DT B

`` `` O

Mr. NNP I

Mr. NNP I

One CD I

acceptable JJ O
to TO O

This DT I

probably RB O

With IN O
a DT I

What WP I

First RB O

Shorn VBN O

insurance NN I

can MD O
still RB O
be VB O
grouped VBN O
under IN O
two CD I
broad JJ I
categories NNS I
: : O
so-called JJ I
pure JJ I
insurance NN I
, , O
which WDT I
amasses VBZ O
no DT I

in IN O
the DT I

and CC O

only RB O
upon IN O
death NN I
, , O
and CC O
permanent JJ I
insurance NN I

which WDT I
provides VBZ O
not RB O
only RB O
a DT I
death NN I
benefit NN I
but CC O
also RB O
a DT I
cash NN I
value NN I
in IN O
the DT I
policy NN I
that WDT B
can MD O
be VB O
used VBN O
in IN O
various JJ I
ways NNS I
while IN O
the DT I
insured VBN I
is VBZ O
still RB O
alive JJ O
. . O

If IN O
all DT I
you PRP B
want VBP O
is VBZ O
death-benefit JJ I
coverage NN I
, , O
pure JJ I
insurance NN I
-- : O
a DT I
term NN I

-- : O
gives VBZ O
you PRP I
maximum JJ B
bang NN I
for IN O
your PRP$ I

, , O
within IN O
limits NNS I

It PRP I
's VBZ O
much RB O
cheaper JJR O
than IN O
permanent JJ I
insurance NN I
bought VBD O
at IN O
the DT I
same JJ I
age NN I
. . O

But CC O
`` `` O
term NN I
'' '' O
means VBZ O
just RB I
that IN I
; : O
the DT I
policy NN I
is VBZ O
written VBN O
for IN O
a DT I
specific JJ I
time NN I
period NN I
only RB I
and CC O
must MD O
be VB O
renewed VBN O
when WRB O
it PRP I
expires VBZ O
. . O

It PRP I
may MD O
also RB O
stipulate VB O
that IN O
the DT I
insured VBN I
must MD O
pass VB O
another DT I
medical JJ I
exam NN I
before IN O
renewal NN I
; : O
if IN O
you PRP I
flunk VBP O
-- : O
which WDT I
means VBZ O
you PRP I
need VBP O
insurance NN I
more JJR O
than IN O
ever RB O
-- : O
you PRP I
may MD O
not RB O
be VB O
able JJ O
to TO O

Even RB O
if IN O
you PRP I
're VBP O
healthy JJ O
and CC O
can MD O
renew VB O
, , O
your PRP$ I
premium NN I
will MD O
go VB O
up IN O
sharply RB O
because IN O
you PRP I
're VBP O
that IN I
much RB O
older JJR O

So RB O
term VBP I

may MD O
not RB O
be VB O
as RB O
cheap JJ O
as IN O
it PRP I
looks VBZ O

There EX I

One CD I
variation NN I
that WDT B
appealed VBD O
to TO O

at IN O
first JJ I
was VBD O
the DT I

Upon IN O

however RB O

Amex NNP I

no DT I

Second JJ O

the DT I

would MD O
be VB O
much RB O

my PRP$ I

income NN I
that WDT B
would MD O
have VB O
exceeded VBN O
the DT I
inflation NN I
rate NN I
and CC O
thus RB O
given VBN O
the DT I
company NN I
a DT B
real JJ I

Third NNP O
and CC O
most RBS O
important JJ O
, , O
Amex NNP I
would MD O
charge VB O
me PRP I
a DT B
far RB I
higher JJR I
premium NN I
than IN O
other JJ I
reputable JJ I

would MD O

straight JJ I

for IN O
the DT I
same JJ I

I PRP I
'd MD O
be VB O
paying VBG O
so RB O
heavily RB O
just RB O
to TO O
have VB O
the DT I
option NN I
of IN O
getting VBG O
my PRP$ I

back RB O
that IN O

'd MD O
almost RB O
have VB O

make VB O
the DT I
whole JJ I

worthwhile JJ O

That DT I
would MD O
be VB O
all DT O
right NN O
with IN O
Amex NNP I
, , O
which WDT I
could MD O
then RB O
lock VB O
in IN O
its PRP$ I

but CC O
it PRP I
does VBZ O

add VB O
up IN O

a DT I
`` `` I

Which WDT I
goes VBZ O

And CC O
the DT I
Second NNP I
Law NNP I

unique JJ O

If IN O

a DT I

the DT I

Always RB O

This DT I
is VBZ O
worth JJ O
remembering NN I
when WRB O
insurers NNS I
and CC O
their PRP$ I
salesmen NNS I
try VBP O
to TO O
sell VB O
you PRP I
permanent JJ B
insurance NN I
, , O
the DT I
kind NN I
that WDT B
amasses VBZ O
cash NN I

The DT I
word NN I
`` `` I
death NN I

can MD O
not RB O
be VB O
escaped VBN O
entirely RB O
by IN O
the DT I
industry NN I

dodge VBP O
it PRP I
wherever WRB O
possible JJ O

to TO O
talk VB O
about IN O
`` `` I

and CC I
`` `` I

'' '' I
instead RB O

The DT I
implication NN I
is VBZ O
that IN O
your PRP$ I
permanent-insurance JJ I
policy NN I
is VBZ O
really RB O
some DT I
kind NN I
of IN O
CD NNP I
or CC O
mutual-fund JJ I

with IN O
an DT I
added VBN I

That DT I
is VBZ O
gilding NN O
the DT I

The DT I
fact NN I
is VBZ O
that IN O
as IN O
a DT I
savings NNS I

insurance NN I
generally RB O
runs VBZ O
a DT I
poor JJ I

you PRP B
might MD O
make VB O
in IN O
the DT I
same JJ I
things NNS I
the DT B
insurance NN I
company NN I
is VBZ O
putting VBG O
your PRP$ I
money NN I
into IN O

That DT I
's VBZ O
because IN O
you PRP I
have VBP O
to TO O
pay VB O
for IN O
the DT I
insurance NN I
portion NN I
of IN O
the DT I

and CC O
the DT I
effort NN I
required VBN O
to TO O
sell VB O
and CC O

the DT I
whole JJ I
package NN I

Again RB O
, , O
no DT I

This DT I
is VBZ O
reflected VBN O
in IN O
a DT I
built-in JJ I
mortality NN I

who WP B
had VBD O
the DT I
effrontery NN I
to TO O
die VB O
while IN O

And CC O
in IN O
most RBS I

a DT I
huge JJ I

So RB O
view VBP O

why WRB O

the DT I
peculiar JJ I
pattern NN I
that IN B

: : O
Prior RB O

a DT I

smaller JJR I
role NN I
in IN O

the DT I
prisoner NN I

dilemma NN I
problem NN I
confronting VBG O
voters NNS I
in IN O

for IN O
Congress NNP I
was VBD O
considerably RB O
less RBR O
severe JJ O

Second JJ O
, , O
it PRP I
explains VBZ O
why WRB O

Congress NNP I
in IN O
disdain NN I
but CC O
generally RB O
love VBP O
their PRP$ I
own JJ I
congressional JJ I

Any DT I

other JJ I

doing VBG O
likewise RB O
for IN O
his PRP$ I
own JJ I

Third NNP O
, , O
the DT I
theory NN I
suggests VBZ O
why WRB O
legislators NNS I
who WP B
pay VBP O
too RB I
much JJ I
attention NN I
to TO O
national JJ I

making VBG I
relative JJ O

For IN O

, , O
first-term JJ I
members NNS I
of IN O
the DT I
House NNP I

once RB O
the DT I
most RBS I
vulnerable JJ I
of IN O
incumbents NNS I

have VBP O
become VBN O
virtually RB O
immune JJ O
to TO O

The DT I
one CD I
exception NN I
to TO O
this DT I
recent JJ I
trend NN I
was VBD O
the DT I
defeat NN I
of IN O

the DT I
Reagan NNP I
revolution NN I
and CC O
running VBG O

re-election NN I
in IN O
1982 CD I

Because IN O
these DT I
freshmen NNS I
placed VBN O

more JJR I
emphasis NN I

role NN I

they PRP I
were VBD O
more RBR O
vulnerable JJ O
to TO O
defeat VB I

Fourth NNP O
, , O
the DT I
theory NN I
indicates VBZ O
why WRB O
the DT I
Republican NNP I
Party NNP I
may MD O
have VB O
a DT I
difficult JJ I
time NN I
attracting VBG O
viable JJ I
candidates NNS I
for IN O

Potential JJ I
candidates NNS I
may MD O
be VB O
discouraged VBN O
from IN O
running VBG O
less JJR O
by IN O
the DT I
congressional JJ I

by IN O
the DT I
prospect NN I
of IN O
defeat NN I
at IN O
the DT I
hands NNS I
of IN O
a DT I
Democratic JJ I

To TO O
the DT I
extent NN I
that IN O
potential JJ I
Republican NNP I
candidates NNS I
and CC O
their PRP$ I
financial JJ I
backers NNS I
realize VBP O
that IN O
the DT I
congressional JJ I

works NNS O
to TO O

the DT I

in IN O
its PRP$ I
attempts NNS I
to TO O
field VB O
a DT I
competitive JJ I
slate NN I
of IN O
congressional JJ I
candidates NNS I

Fifth NNP O
, , O
the DT I
theory NN I
may MD O
provide VB O
at IN I
least JJS I
a DT I
partial JJ I
reason NN I
for IN O
why WRB O
ticket NN I
splitting NN I
has VBZ O
been VBN O
particularly RB O
pronounced VBN O
in IN O
the DT I
South NNP I

To TO O
the DT I
extent NN I
that IN O
Democratic JJ I
legislators NNS I
from IN O
the DT I
South NNP I
have VBP O
held VBN O
a DT I
disproportionate JJ I
share NN I
of IN O
power NN I
in IN O
Congress NNP I
since IN O
1932 CD I
and CC O
have VBP O
been VBN O
able JJ O
to TO O
translate VB O
such JJ I
clout NN I
into IN O
relatively RB I
more RBR I
local JJ I
benefits NNS I
for IN O
their PRP$ I
respective JJ I
constituencies NNS I

voters NNS I
in IN O
the DT I
South NNP I

had VBN O
an DT I
especially RB I
strong JJ I
incentive NN I
to TO O
keep VB O
such JJ I
Democrats NNPS I
in IN O
office NN I

Finally RB O
, , O
the DT I
theory NN I
suggests VBZ O
why WRB O
Republicans NNPS I
generally RB O
have VBP O
fared VBN O
better JJR O
in IN O
Senate NNP I

than IN O
in IN O

Since IN O

more JJR O

matters NNS O
less JJR O
in IN O
the DT I

this DT I

precisely RB O
the DT I

willing JJ O

counterparts NNS I

Is VBZ O
there EX I
any DT B
empirical JJ I
support NN I
for IN O
this DT I
theory NN I
? . O

Three CD I
pieces NNS I
of IN O
evidence NN I
corroborate VB O
the DT I
key JJ I
assumption NN I
that IN O
Democratic JJ I
legislators NNS I
are VBP O
more RBR O
willing JJ O
to TO O
engage VB O
in IN O
local JJ I
benefit-seeking NN I

First RB O

economists NNS I
James NNP I

To TO O
the DT I
extent NN I
that IN O
the DT I
primary JJ I
duty NN I
of IN O
personal JJ I

involves VBZ O
local JJ I
benefit-seeking NN I
, , O
this DT I
indicates VBZ O
that IN O

leads VBZ O
congressional JJ I
Republicans NNPS I
to TO O
pay VB O
less JJR I
attention NN I
to TO O
narrow VB I

Second JJ O

if IN O

valid JJ O

Democrats NNPS I
should MD O
have VB O
lower JJR I

do VBP O
to TO O
the DT I

that IN O
such JJ I

reflect VBP O
national JJ I
policy NN I
making VBG I

that IN O

takes VBZ O
away RB O
from IN O
the DT I

a DT B

could MD O
otherwise RB O
devote VB O
to TO O

This DT I

what WP I
the DT B

particularly RB O
in IN O
the DT I

Finally RB O

as IN O

The DT I

the DT I
one CD I

that IN O

That DT I

The DT I
Cambodian JJ I

that IN O
the DT I

a DT I

just RB O

there EX I

it PRP I

they PRP I

for IN O
two CD I
reasons NNS I

First RB O
, , O
its PRP$ I
position NN I
in IN O
the DT I
government NN I
is VBZ O
anomalous JJ O

It PRP I
has VBZ O
an DT I
unusual JJ I
kind NN I
of IN O
independence NN I
from IN O

still RB O
has VBZ O
authority NN I
over IN O
one CD I
of IN O
the DT I
most RBS I

of IN O

-- : O
the DT I
control NN I

Thus RB O
we PRP I
have VBP O
a DT I
condition NN I
that WDT B
is VBZ O
easily RB O
described VBN O
as IN O
undemocratic JJ O
. . O

Second JJ O
, , O
the DT I
responsibilities NNS I
of IN O
the DT I
Federal NNP I
Reserve NNP I
as IN O
guardian NN I
of IN O
the DT I

, , O
which WDT I
means VBZ O
as IN O
guardian NN I
of IN O
the DT I
stability NN I
of IN O
the DT I
price NN I

, , O
sometimes RB O
lead VB O
it PRP I

take VB O
measures NNS I
that WDT B

unpopular JJ O

As IN O
former JJ I

the DT I
punch NN I

just RB O
as IN O
the DT I

getting VBG O
interesting JJ O

So RB O
the DT I
Federal NNP I

is VBZ O
an DT I
attractive JJ I
target NN I
for IN O
complaint NN I
by IN O
politicians NNS I

The DT I
Fed NNP I

easily RB O

the DT I
blame NN I

unpleasantness NN I

like IN O
high JJ I

or CC O
slow JJ I

while IN O
the DT I

can MD O
escape VB O
responsibility NN I
by IN O
pointing VBG O

the DT I

This DT I
leads VBZ O

proposals NNS I

`` `` O

which WDT I

any DT I

of IN O
additional JJ I

These DT I

include VBP O

both DT O

Part NN I
of IN O
the DT I
answer NN I
lies VBZ O
in IN O
the DT I
nature NN I
of IN O
the DT I

Many RB I

Mr. NNP I

say VBP O
that IN O

The DT I

behind IN O

is VBZ O
pretty RB I

: : O
put VB O

can MD O
crack VB O
about IN I
20,000 CD I

Because IN O
fresh JJ I

are VBP O
less RBR O

a DT I

says VBZ O
Mr. NNP I

Such JJ I
centrifugal JJ I

have VBP O
been VBN O
around IN O
since IN O
the DT I

But CC O
when WRB O

The DT I
main JJ I
reason NN I
: : O
salmonella NN I

Chickens NNS I
carry VBP O
this DT I
bacteria NNS I

which WDT I

and CC O
it PRP I
can MD O
also RB O
be VB O

Thus RB O
, , O
any DT I
machine NN I
that IN B
breaks VBZ O
large JJ I

of IN O

at IN O
once RB O
has VBZ O
the DT I

An DT I
early JJ I
battleground NN I
was VBD O
the DT I
U.S. NNP I

Mr. NNP I

initially RB O
won VBD O

Unfortunately RB O
for IN O
Mr. NNP I

the DT I

After IN O
receiving VBG O
complaints NNS I
from IN O

this DT I

got VBD O
the DT I
other JJ I

to TO O
rescind VB O

thus RB O
limiting VBG O
the DT I

potential JJ I

The DT I
egg NN I

also RB O
lobbied VBD O
the DT I

But CC O
the DT I
FDA NNP I
in IN O
a DT I
1985 CD I

So RB O
the DT I

Mr. NNP I

finally RB O
defeated VBN O

Even RB O
