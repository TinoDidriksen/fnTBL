2. Testing

  To test POS tagging (the only task provided so far), change to the
directory $BASE_DIR/test-case/pos-tagging, and run the following
command:

 ../../exec/pos-train.prl -F tbl.lexical.train.params,tbl.context.pos.params \
	-r 0.4 -R lexical.rls,context.rls -S 11.part1,11.part2 \
	-t NN,NNP -T 2,2 -f 5 -v -D my_pos_dir 11

 (omit the -v flag if you don't want to see things flying on the
screen :) - or you could possibly redirect the stderr to a file, for
later examination).  When the command finishes (if it finishes
correctly), you can run the following command:

 ../../exec/pos-apply.prl -D my_pos_dir -v 22
   
The results obtained (22.res and the 2 rule files lexical.rls and
context.rls) should be similar (but not necessarily identical, because
of the randomness involved in creating the files) to the corresponding
"official" ones 22.official.res, lexical.official.rls and
context.official.rls - if they are significantly different, probably
something went wrong. If the flag -S is used (as in the previous
command) and the files 11.part1 and 11.part2 are identical to the ones
in the distribution, then the output rule files should be identical to
the ones provided (the "official" ones); same with the output file
(22.res).
