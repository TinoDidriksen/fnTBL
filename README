Welcome to the fnTBL toolkit, version 1.2.

Latest version of this toolkit can be downloaded from

  http://nlp.cs.jhu.edu/~rflorian/fntbl/index.html

0. Requirements 

 o To build the sources, you need a C++ compiler that comes with the
STL library (egcs, gcc >= 2.95.2 -- to see what version of compiler
you have, use `gcc -v'). It has been tested with the following
compilers:

   - gcc 2.95.2 under Linux, Solaris and Windows;
   - gcc 3.0 under Linux;
   - egcs 2.91.66 under Linux;

 o To use the scripts that come with the distribution you have to
have Perl installed on your system.

1. Instalation

From sources:
  The instalation is pretty easy. Change the directory to the source
directory and run the command 'make all'

  cd $BASE_DIR
  make all

  Before running the make command, edit the Makefile such that the
variable CC points to the main gcc/g++ executable (but only if you have
multiple versions defined; if you have just one, you can run the make
command directly). When the compilation is complete, you're set!

From binaries:
  If you chose to use a provided binary (so far, Linux, Solaris and
Windows distributions have been built), then you should run the
following commands:

  cd $BASE_DIR
  make binary

  This should transform the perl scripts such that they can be used directly.

----------------

2. Testing

  To test POS tagging (one of 4 tasks provided so far), change to the
directory $BASE_DIR/test-case/pos-tagging, and run the following
command:

 ../../exec/pos-train.prl -F tbl.lexical.train.params,tbl.context.pos.params \
	-r 0.4 -R lexical.rls,context.rls -S 11.part1,11.part2 \
	-t NN,NNP -T 2,2 -f 5 -v -D my_pos_dir 11

 (omit the -v flag if you don't want to see things flying on the
screen :) - or you could possibly redirect the stderr to a file, for
later examination).  When the command finishes (if it finishes
correctly), you can run the following command:

 ../../exec/pos-apply.prl -D my_pos_dir -v 22
   
The results obtained (22.res and the 2 rule files lexical.rls and
context.rls) should be similar (but not necessarily identical, because
of the randomness involved in creating the files) to the corresponding
"official" ones 22.official.res, lexical.official.rls and
context.official.rls - if they are significantly different, probably
something went wrong. If the flag -S is used (as in the previous
command) and the files 11.part1 and 11.part2 are identical to the ones
in the distribution, then the output rule files should be identical to
the ones provided (the "official" ones); same with the output file
(22.res).


3. Documentation

In the directory $BASE_DIR/docs there are a bunch of files that
presumbably document the system. The main file, tbl-toolkit.ps,
describes the system in general, gives an overview of the parameters,
and takes a deep look into POS tagging (for now; in the near future it
will also inspect PP attachment and text chunking; however POS tagging
is the one with the most options and the most confusing one). Also
distributed are 3 articles that are the foundation of the toolkit.

 You can access the documentation in HTML format from the main web
page.

4. Bugs

Of course there are bugs. Here's one: the probability generation
system is not working properly. We know about it and we are working on
re-integrating the probabilities back in the system. You have found
another one? Please report it to rflorian@cs.jhu.edu, describing how
you got it and, if you can replicate it, describe the sequence of
steps that resulted in the bug. Also a snippet of the data on which
the system is failing would be most appreciated; the authors promise
to discard the data as soon as possible (i.e. the bug is fixed), and
not to use it in any other way than fixing the bug. Also all the
configuration files that were used should be included.

Well, this product is free for anyone that wants to use it, for any
purposes other than war. The only request I have is that if you use
this toolkit and report the results in a written form, to acknowledge
the authors and their paper in which it was presented (I'm even
providing the bibtex entry, and the .bbl entry, heh):

@InProceedings{ngaiflorian01,
  author =               {Grace Ngai and Radu Florian},
  title =                {Transformation-Based Learning in the Fast Lane},
  booktitle =    {Proceedings of North Americal ACL 2001},
  Month =        {June},
  pages =        {40-47},
  year =                 2001
}

\bibitem{ngaiflorian01}
Grace Ngai and Radu Florian.

\newblock In {\em Proceedings of North Americal ACL 2001}, pages 40--47, June
  2001.

  Also, if you use the multitask capability of the fnTBL toolkit
(predict multiple labels at once), a citation to:

\bibitem{florian01}
Radu Florian and Grace Ngai.
\newblock Multidimensional transformational-based learning.
\newblock {\em Proceedings of the fifth Conference on Computational Natural
  Language Learning, CoNLL 2001}, pages 1--8, July 2001.

@Article{florian01,

  title =  {Multidimensional Transformational-Based Learning},
  journal = {Proceedings of the fifth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, CoNLL 2001},

  would be greatly appreciated. 

  Enjoy,
