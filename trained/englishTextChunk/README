Text Chunking:

  We assume that the input data has already POS assigned to them.
If not, please use the POS tagger provided to assign POS tags.

  The input should be 1-word-per-line, sentences separated by empty
lines. Each sample should consist of the word and POS attached to it
(either the correct one, or one assigned by a POS tagger). Let's assume this file is called 'test'.

  The test.me script will run the fnTBL program on the data, and it
should be launched as:

	./test.me test.dat

  The result will be written in the file 'test.res'.

  The rules were obtained by training the fnTBL program on sections
1-21 of the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank. The chunk
tags were obtained by running the script 'chunklink.pl' written by
Sabine Buchholz, and that can be obtained from
	http://ilk.kub.nl/~sabine/chunklink/

  Testing on section 0 of the same corpus yielded a performance of
94.99 Fmeasure (precision 94.90%, recall 95.08%, accuracy 95.91%).

  Observation: it turns out to be better to chunk the text if one
wants to do base NP chunking, as more information about the context
(B-VP, I-ADJP instead of just O) helps. Testing just for baseNP yields
a performance of 93.97 Fmeasure (precision 94.15%, recall 93.79%),
compared with 92.61 when the system is trained to recognize only base
noun phrases (see ../baseNP/README).
