English POS:

  To POS tag a text file <file> with fnTBL, one should run the
following command:

../../exec/pos-apply.prl -T <training_directory> \
			 -o <file.out> -v <file>

        (replace <training_directory>, <file> and <file.out> 
	 with your file names)

  The file <file> should be in a 1-word-per-line format, with
sentences separated by one blank line. Additionally, the words could
have the correct tag attached, in which case the tag will be copied in
the third field.

  After running the previous command, the text will have 3 columns:
  1. the word
  2. the guessed POS
  3. the true POS (if present in the <file>), or the character -.

  No tokenization or preprocessing is done to the input file - they
should be done before running the POS tagger.

  The program can be run also from other directory than the one where
the files are, by using the -T flag. In that case, you will need to
adjust the path to the pos-apply script. The -T flag should point to
the directory where the files are stored (the trained/englishPOS
directory).

  This system has been trained on sections 01-21 of the Wall Street
Journal section of the Penn Treebank. When tested on section 00 of the
same corpus, it yielded a POS accuracy of 96.78%.
