The
man
was
watching
me
,
his
eyes
grey
like
the
sea
.

He
had
a
long
,
angular
face
,
and
his
expression
was
steady
,
in
contrast
to
his
wife
's
,
which
flickered
like
a
candle
.

He
had
no
beard
or
moustache
,
and
I
was
glad
,
for
it
gave
him
a
clean
appearance
.

He
wore
a
black
cloak
over
his
shoulders
,
a
white
shirt
,
and
a
fine
lace
collar
.

His
hat
pressed
into
hair
the
red
of
brick
washed
by
rain
.

'
What
have
you
been
doing
here
,
Griet
?
he
asked
.

I
was
surprised
by
the
question
but
knew
enough
to
hide
it
.

'
Chopping
vegetables
,
sir
.

For
the
soup
.

'
I
always
laid
vegetables
out
in
a
circle
,
each
with
its
own
section
like
a
slice
of
pie
.

There
were
five
slices
:
red
cabbage
,
onions
,
leeks
,
carrots
and
turnips
.

I
had
used
a
knife
edge
to
shape
each
slice
,
and
placed
a
carrot
disc
in
the
centre
.

The
man
tapped
his
finger
on
the
table
.

'
Are
they
laid
out
in
the
order
in
which
they
will
go
into
the
soup
?
'
he
suggested
,
studying
the
circle
.

'
No
,
Sir
.

'
I
hesitated
.

I
could
not
say
why
I
had
laid
out
the
vegetables
as
I
did
.

I
simply
set
them
as
I
felt
they
should
be
,
but
I
was
too
frightened
to
say
so
to
a
gentleman
.

'
I
see
you
have
separated
the
whites
,
'
he
said
,
indicating
the
turnips
and
onions
.

'
And
then
the
orange
and
the
purple
,
they
do
not
sit
together
.

Why
is
that
?
'

He
picked
up
a
shred
of
cabbage
and
a
piece
of
carrot
and
shook
them
like
dice
in
his
hand
.

I
looked
at
my
mother
,
who
nodded
slightly
.

'
The
colours
fight
when
they
are
side
by
side
,
sir
.

'
He
arched
his
eyebrows
,
as
if
he
had
not
expected
such
a
response
.

'
And
do
you
spend
much
time
setting
out
the
vegetables
before
you
make
the
soup
?

''
Oh
no
,
sir
,
'
I
replied
,
confused
.

I
did
not
want
him
to
think
I
was
idle
.
